# Instructions

Process the task list using the fidelity-preserving approach to maintain exact scope as specified in the source document. This command uses developer-fidelity and quality-reviewer-fidelity agents to implement only what's explicitly specified, without additions or scope expansions.
$ARGUMENTS.

## Task File Validation

Before processing tasks, validate the task file is ready:

1. **Validate Task File Exists:**
   - Check task file exists at provided path
   - Confirm file is readable markdown format
   - If file not found, report clear error message and halt

2. **Validate YAML Front-matter:**
   - Parse YAML front-matter for required fields:
     - `source_prd` OR `source_specification`: Path to source document (verify file exists)
     - `fidelity_mode`: Should be "strict"
     - `agents`: Extract developer and reviewer agent names
     - `complexity_level`: (optional, for specs) Note the depth level
     - `validated`: Should be `true` (indicates task coverage was validated)
   - If YAML is missing or incomplete:
     - Report specific missing fields
     - Suggest running appropriate gen-tasks command again
     - Halt processing

3. **Validate Source Document:**
   - Check that source document file exists (from `source_prd` or `source_specification` field)
   - Detect source type: PRD if `source_prd` present, specification if `source_specification` present
   - If source document missing:
     - Report error: "Source [PRD/specification] not found at [path]"
     - Cannot proceed without source document
     - Halt processing
   - If source document exists, note its location and type for reference during implementation

4. **Validate Task Structure:**
   - Verify task file contains task lists (checkboxes)
   - Check for parent/child task structure (and phase structure if present)
   - Confirm "Relevant Files" or "Implementation Files" section is present
   - If structure is malformed:
     - Report specific structural issues
     - Suggest fixes or regeneration
     - Halt processing

5. **Validate Dependencies:**
   - Check files mentioned in "Relevant Files" or "Implementation Files" section:
     - For existing files: Verify they exist
     - For new files: Verify parent directories exist or can be created
   - Check for external dependencies (libraries, APIs) mentioned in tasks
   - If critical dependencies missing:
     - Report missing dependencies
     - Suggest installation steps if known
     - Ask user if they want to proceed anyway
   - If validation successful, proceed to fidelity preservation

**Error Handling:** If any validation fails:
- Provide clear, specific error message
- Suggest remediation steps
- Do NOT proceed with implementation
- Allow graceful exit

## Fidelity Preservation Process

After successful validation, prepare for task implementation:

1. **Parse Task File Metadata:** Extract fidelity information from validated YAML front-matter
2. **Use Fidelity Agents:** Always use fidelity-preserving agents for implementation:
   - Developer agent: `@developer-fidelity`
   - Quality reviewer: `@quality-reviewer-fidelity`
3. **Apply Only Specified Validation:** Include only the testing and validation explicitly specified in the source document:
   - Review source document for testing requirements
   - Implement only specified security measures
   - Do not add tests or validation beyond what's explicitly required

4. **Initialize Progress Tracking:**
   - Count total phases (if present), parent tasks, and subtasks for progress reporting
   - Note complexity level if specified (simple/standard/comprehensive)
   - Display initial progress: "📊 Starting implementation: [X phases,] Y parent tasks, Z subtasks total"

<skip_subtask_confirmation>
If $ARGUMENTS contains NOSUBCONF then ignore subtask confirmation in task implementation below
</skip_subtask_confirmation>

## Progress Indicators

Throughout implementation, provide clear status updates:

**Phase Progress (if applicable):**
- When starting a phase: "🔄 **Phase N/X**: [Phase Name] - Starting..."
- When completing a phase: "✅ **Phase N/X Complete** - [Brief summary of accomplishments]"

**Task Progress:**
- When starting a parent task: "📝 **Task N.0**: [Task Name] - [M subtasks]"
- When completing a subtask: "✅ **Subtask N.M** complete ([M/Total] subtasks [in this phase])"
- After validation: "🔍 Running validation: lint → build → [secrets →] tests..."
- After quality review: "👁️ Quality review passed using @quality-reviewer-fidelity"

**Error Reporting:**
- If validation fails: "❌ **Validation Failed**: [specific issue] - Fixing before commit..."
- If critical error: "🛑 **Critical Error**: [issue] - Stopping work for user intervention"

**Overall Progress:**
- Periodically (every 3-5 subtasks): "📊 **Progress**: N% complete (X/Y tasks done)"

# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing source document implementations

## Task Implementation

## Critical Task Update Protocol

**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT SYSTEM:** After completing ANY subtask, Claude MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Declare completion with mandatory update statement:**
   "✅ Subtask [X.Y] [task name] completed.
   🔄 UPDATING MARKDOWN FILE NOW..."

2. **Immediately perform the markdown update:**

- Use Edit tool to change `- [ ] X.Y [task name]` to `- [x] X.Y [task name]`
- Show the actual edit operation in the response

3. **Confirm update completion:**
   "✅ Markdown file updated: [ ] → [x] for subtask X.Y
   📋 Task list is now current."

4. **Request permission to proceed (unless NOSUBCONF specified):**
   "Ready to proceed to next subtask. May I continue? (y/n)"

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL IS A CRITICAL ERROR.** If Claude completes a subtask without immediately updating the markdown file, it MUST:

- Stop all work immediately
- State: "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: I failed to update the task list. Stopping work."
- Wait for user intervention before proceeding

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:** After each edit, Claude must show the updated section of the markdown file to confirm the change was made correctly.

- Do not proceed with tasks unless you are on a git branch other than main
- If needed, create a branch for the phase of work you are implementing
  - Parent agent (you) are responsible for git branch creation, not subagents
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y" UNLESS NOSUBCONF is specified by the user
- **Completion protocol:**

  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.

  - **MANDATORY TASK UPDATE:** Before doing anything else after subtask completion, immediately update the markdown file `[ ]` → `[x]` and confirm the update was successful

  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:

  - **First**: Run validation checks appropriate to source document and complexity level:
    - **For PRDs or simple specs**: lint, build (if build script exists)
    - **For standard specs**: lint, build, unit tests
    - **For comprehensive specs**: lint, build, secrets scan, unit tests
    - If source document specifies additional validation, include that too
  - **Only if all validations pass**: Stage changes (`git add .`)
  - **Quality Review**: Use fidelity-preserving quality reviewer agent for final approval
  - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
  - **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that:

    - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
    - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
    - Lists key changes and additions
    - References the phase number and source context
    - **Formats the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags**, e.g.:

      ```
      git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to Phase 2.1"
      ```

  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the **parent task** as completed.

- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead UNLESS NOSUBCONF is specified by the user

- Always stop after parent tasks complete, run test suite, and commit changes

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**

   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" or "Implementation Files" section:**

   - List every file created or modified during implementation.
   - Update descriptions as implementation progresses.
   - Add new files discovered during implementation.

3. **Context Validation (for rich execution plans):**
   - Ensure implementation stays true to source document's technical specifications.
   - Validate security requirements are being followed.
   - Confirm performance benchmarks are being met.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks while maintaining phase structure (if applicable).
4. Keep "Relevant Files" or "Implementation Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next and review context sections if present.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
7. For rich execution plans: Reference preserved context when making implementation decisions.
8. For rich execution plans: Ensure traceability between implementation and source document rationale.
9. For rich execution plans: Validate against success criteria throughout implementation.
10. **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** After each subtask completion, Claude MUST immediately declare completion, update the markdown file, show the edit, confirm the update, and request permission to continue. Failure to do this is a critical error that requires stopping all work.

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Source Detection:** Auto-detect whether source is PRD or specification based on YAML front-matter
2. **Validation Levels:** Adapt validation rigor to complexity level (simple/standard/comprehensive) if specified
3. **Progress Transparency:** Provide regular status updates for long-running implementations
4. **Error Recovery:** If validation fails, fix issues before proceeding to next task
5. **Dependency Awareness:** Reference validated files section for file operations
6. **Fidelity Adherence:** Constantly reference source document to prevent scope creep
7. **Graceful Degradation:** If optional dependencies missing, ask user before proceeding
8. **Clear Communication:** Use progress indicators to keep user informed of status
